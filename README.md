## Usage

Honestly, there is no spesific usage. But, alright, if you insist.

### Want to use a cron-job?

Just set it up yourself using the `crontab -e` command and use the available commands (CLI)?

### Want to use the http-api?

Sure... Just visit
[http://localhost:3000/publish?secret=y0ur.s3cr3t](http://localhost:3000/publish?secret=y0ur.s3cr3t)

### Want to deploy on Vercel?

Hold on for a moment, still working on college assignments.

## FAQ

### Why use `bun`?

Because `bun` is very fast!

### Can it be run with Node.js or Deno?

Not at the moment. I don't have enough time for that.

### Why is the threads-api stored in the modules directory?

Because currently, threads-api does not support bun, but bun is very reliable if only asked to run
TypeScript, that's why I made threads-api as a submodule in git, so that it still uses TypeScript
and not the JavaScript build result. By the way, I have opened an issue related to this
[here](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api/issues/206).

### Why can't I access the `quran-kemenag` and `tafsir` submodules?

Simple, that repository is a "trust", we cannot make it public, for one or two reasons, instead, we
have copied the parsed data result in the [`data`](./data/) directory, I don't think anything is
missing there.

### Where is the source data for the tafsir?

- [Tafsir Kemenag RI](https://quran.kemenag.go.id)
- Tafsir al-Muyassar
- Tafsir al-Mukhtashar
- Tafsir Juz 'Amma by Syaikh Prof. Dr. Shalih Fauzan al-Fauzan
- Zubdatut Tafsir
- Tafsir al-Wajiz by Syaikh Prof. Dr. Wahbah az-Zuhaili
- Tafsir Juz 'Amma by Syaikh Muhammad bin Shalih al-Utsaimin
- Tafsir Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah
- Tafsir as-Sa'di
- Tafsir Hidayatul Insan
- Tafsir ash-Shaghir

### Is the data used authentic?

InshaAllah, it's authentic. If there are any errors, please report them!

### What about the ayah of the Qur'an and their translations?

Like the existing submodule, [`quran-kemenag`](./modules/quran-kemenag/), it's obtained from
[Qur'an Kemenag RI](https://quran.kemenag.go.id). The RESTful API is provided for free (even
without documentation), you can get it from Network - DevTools.

### Is this halal (permissible)?

I'm not a scholar who can issue fatwas, but from some sources I've come across, it's considered
mubah (permissible)! That means, it's okay to use this. It might potentially be rewarding, as we
are sharing ayah from the Kalamullah (Quran). InshaAllah.

## License
